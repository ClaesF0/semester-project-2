Quick start:
https://tailwind-elements.com/quick-start/

For this project you need to be familiar with:
Vite
https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite

        NODE
        https://nodejs.org/en/

        Tailwind (link to official docs)
        https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation

        Link to video-resource for setting up Tailwind, and some free elements. (Please note that the script in head is from this page)
        https://tailwind-elements.com/quick-start/

        Additional tools:
        https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint
        https://github.com/prettier/prettier
        https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started

Once these steps are set up, please:
1: open your terminal (bash is my preferred)
2: 'dir' in terminal to assure you are in the directory "/YOUR SOURCE/npm-vite-boilerplate-2/Tailwind-boilerplate"
if not, then change directory (type "cd" (on Windows)) until you are in
"/YOUR SOURCE/npm-vite-boilerplate-2/Tailwind-boilerplate"

3: "npm run build"
4: "npm run dev"

5: Ctrl+click the link, open your browser

It should work now.
